Use `tanh` as an activation function for the hidden layers. Compute both feedforward and backpropagation paths to update the model weights and produce predictions (you might want to check out [this post](https://medium.com/@Coursesteach/deep-learning-part-25-derivatives-of-activation-functions-4bbd7c7c7a1c) about the derivatives of the most popular activation functions).
